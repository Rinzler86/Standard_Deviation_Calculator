This Python script creates a GUI application using Tkinter for calculating the standard deviation, mean, median, mode, and range of a user-entered set of numbers. It also displays these statistics on the application window and visualizes the sorted data using a bar and scatter plot with matplotlib. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

User Interface Setup:

Initializes a Tkinter window with a black background, titled "Standard Deviation Calculator".
Provides an entry widget for users to input numbers and buttons for submitting the data, calculating statistics, and resetting the form.
Data Entry and Validation:

The add_to_list function allows users to add numbers to a list. It checks for empty inputs and shows an error message if no number is entered.
Submitted numbers are displayed on the GUI as labels, providing a visual reference of entered data.
Statistical Calculations:

On pressing the "Calculate" button, the standard_deviation function is called. It calculates the mean, standard deviation, median, mode, and range of the entered numbers.
These statistics are then displayed on the GUI, and the data is visualized using matplotlib in a new window, showing both a bar and scatter plot of the sorted numbers.
Data Visualization:

Uses matplotlib to create a bar and scatter plot of the entered numbers, providing a visual analysis of the data distribution.
Reset Functionality:

The reset function clears all entered data and statistics from the GUI and closes any open matplotlib plots, allowing users to start afresh.
Additional Features:

The application window is set to a specific size and position, and the layout is organized with labels and buttons placed at predetermined positions for a user-friendly experience.
Notable Aspects and Best Practices:
Modular Design: Functions are used to segment the code logically, facilitating readability and maintenance.
Error Handling: Input validation is performed to ensure that only valid numbers are added to the list, enhancing the robustness of the application.
User Feedback: Immediate visual feedback is provided through GUI updates and error messages, improving user experience.
Visual Data Representation: Incorporating matplotlib for data visualization offers users additional insights into their entered data.
